            <h2>The Shpeel</h2>
            <p>Chrismas on the farm is postponed until the 28<sup>th</sup> of December this year because some of us have mulitple parties we wish to attend, but none of us can teleport or wish to re-enact that hilarious episode of the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0739937/?ref_=tt_rvi_tt_i_1">Vicar of Dibley</a> (which we will be watching).</p>
            <p>This is tentative atm so if you wish to attend but the postponed date still doesn't work for you then please don't hesitate to <a id="sms" href="sms: +61408039822">contact admin</a>.</p>

            <h2>How this is gonna go down.</h2>
            <p>You are welcome to arrive at the farm whenever you wish. </p>
            <p>The 27<sup>th</sup> is buy-all-of-the-food day. If you have any dietary requirements please contact the <a href="sms: +16408039822">catering team</a> before this day.</p>
            <p>Backed by popular demand and tradition, there will be christmas pudding this year so bring your wits or a mouthguard, we don't care which one.</p>
            <p>The exchanging of gifts will happen on the 28<sup>th</sup> at 5am, sharp.</p>
            <p>Uncle Michael's is the venue for the main event.</p>
            <p>Viewing of the Vicar of Dibley will be happening around 5pm and dinner will just be the leftovers.</p>
            <p>The rest of the day is unplanned as this is not a dictorship and flexability in the schedule allows for spontenaity which is the greatest spice of life.</p>
